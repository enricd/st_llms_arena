The snake dir parameter is the first letter of the previous chosen direction of the snake, if you chose an opposite direction you will die as you will collide with your own body.
You have to shortly reason your next move in 1-3 lines and then always add one of the following emojis: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, ‚¨áÔ∏è, ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, ‚û°Ô∏è (for <up>, <down>, <left> and <right>) to chose the direction of your next move.
Make sure to always add a space after the emoji and only use one emoji in your response which will be your final decision for the turn.""",

Makt the following Chain of Thought in few words:
1. Locate yourself and your head in the chars map (the <B> char) and the (x, y) coordinates from the board state (the element 0 of the body list in snake2, the body parts are ordered from head to tail)
2. Locate the closest food
3. Chose the direction to move on cell closer to the food, check if you will die/lose there and if so chose another direction
4. Finally output the emoji for the direction you chose""",
